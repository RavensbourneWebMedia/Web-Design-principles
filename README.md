<!--# Web Design principles-->

### During this project you will learn the principles of visual communication by researching and designing *objects that communicate*. 

In particular, you will:

* Examine how people **make sense of visual perceptions**, which will help you make informed design decisions.
* Explore different ways of looking at and framing everyday objects through **photography** and **image manipulation**.
* Experiment with **typography** and **graphic layout** to turn data into information and evoke meaning.
* Use **HTML** and **CSS** to turn unstructured data into structured, aesthetically cohesive and accessible information.
* Get familiar with the edgeless medium of the Web and **Responsive Web Design** methods.
* Work in **teams**, learning from your peers and teaching them what you learned.
* **Document** your work regularly and **reflect** on your creative process.

# Projects

### EyeBombing

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. Looking at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and using **photography** to frame them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

All the project material is [here](projects/eye-bombing).

### OneTweet

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](projects/one-tweet).

### The Union Hack

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](projects/union-hack).

### Code in your plate

This project introduces you to **coding** as a process of *translation*: from ideas to words, from words to sketches, from sketches to technical descriptions in various languages. 

You will get familiar with 2 of the 3 languages of the Web: **HTML** and **CSS** (JavaScript next term).

All the project material is [here](projects/code-in-your-plate).


# Learning goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Use **principles of visual perception** to make informed design decisions.
* Experiment with framing, lighting and colour to create and manipulate **photographic images**.
* Tinker with fonts, sizes and layout (aka **typography**) to create meaning and evoke emotions with text.
* Play with ideas and turn them into visual **symbols** and shapes.
* Turn unstructured data into structured, aesthetically cohesive and accessible information using **HTML** and **CSS**.
* **Document** your creative process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.
* Adapt your **communication** to different audiences and contexts (eg: team meeting vs presentation).
* Use the Git version-control system (through GitHub) to **collaborate** with your team and **back-up** your project files.


# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
