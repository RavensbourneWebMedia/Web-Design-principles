# EyeBombing

This **team project** is about *looking* and *creating images*. 

We're so used to the things we see every day that we sometimes forget to *look* at them, and realise that there are many different *perspectives* from which we can observe them and *capture* their appearances.

We'll look at everyday objects and our surroundings with different eyes and use **photography** to *frame* them, so that others can see what we want them to see.

1. Form **teams** of 2-3 people
* Look for **faces** in everyday objects and your surroundings.
* **Photograph** them. Don't take just one picture of a subject, but capture it from many different angles. The more, the better (see [criteria](#criteria) below).
* Photographs can be **edited**, in which case you must submit both the original shot and the edited image.
* Create a *GitHub repository* for your team project and **submit** all your images there. 

<!---->

* **Bonus 1** Add documentation (eg: the same subject from many different angles or at different times), research and inspiration material to the GitHub repository. 
* **Bonus 2** Tweet your images, tag them with *#RaveFWD* (FWD = Fundamentals of Web Design) and cc [@RaveWebMedia](https://twitter.com/ravewebmedia).

### Criteria

When reviewing your images, we will look for: 

* **Originality** of your subject, the less *in-your-face* (obvious / common) a subject the better.
* **Manipulation**, the less you interfered with a subject the better. For instance, drawing a face on a dusty surface is not the point of this project. Arranging objects to resemble a face is ok, but we prefer *ready-made* subjects, which you simply found and framed, rather than manipulated.
* **Framing**, the point(s) of view you chose for your subject to highlight its *faceyness*. Framing an image has as much to do with what you include as what you exclude. 
* **Interpretation**, how your subject is cropped (or otherwise edited) to highlight its *faceyness*.



### Inspirations

* [Faces in places](http://facesinplaces.blogspot.co.uk) is a photographic collection of **faces found in everyday places**, curated by [Jody Smith](https://twitter.com/ToastMaster).

* [Ways of Seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfB-pUm3eI) is a BBC series (and a book) that analyse traditional Western cultural aesthetics and raise questions about hidden **ideologies in visual images**.  

### Tutorials and tools

Photography courses on Lynda.com, which you have free access to as a Ravensbourne student (go to [tinyurl.com/ravelynda](http://tinyurl.com/ravelynda)), in particular:

* You can start from [this short video](http://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/Seeing-compositing-possibilities/374612/411110-4.html) about seeing the **possibilities** for how a scene or subject can be framed (*framing* and *composition* can be used as synonyms for the sake of our project).
* Follow this [foundation course on composition](http://www.lynda.com/Photography-Photo-Assignments-tutorials/Foundations-of-Photography-Composition/80299-2.html).
* Try this [challenge](http://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/5-Day-Photo-Challenge-Composition/383423-2.html).
