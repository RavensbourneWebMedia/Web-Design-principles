# Project

### OneTweet tutorials

This project is about about **typography** and creating *meaning with text*.

All the project material is [here](../../projects/one-tweet).

This is *not a team project* but we'll see people in groups of 2-3, possibly grouping people who are working on the same tweet.

### 4 groups

### 15 minutes per group 

That is, ~5 minutes per person.

1. Let's see your **posters**.
* Which tweet did you choose and why?
* What variations did you produce? 
* Which visual perception principles have you explored (either alone or in combos)?
* What fonts and colours did you pick?
* What ideas could you *steal* (ehm, `fork`) from your peers?


# Team project

### The Union Hack 

This **team project** is about about **symbols** and **brands**. By designing flags, you will devise symbols to represent identities and convert ideas into shapes. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/union-hack).

Today:

1. Form teams.
* Set up a GitHub repository for your team project.

Between today and next week:

1. Mash up existing flags.
* Jot down ideas for places (real or imaginary) and the flag(s) you could design for them. 
* Record your creative process in your blogs.

Next week:

Formative Assessment

The Week After:

1. We'll review your work in class
	
	* What have you made?
	* How can you improve it?
* Continue mashing up existing flags and designing new flags.	

Formative presentation (28.10):

1. Present your work as a team, both process and results.
* Reflect on what you learned from it.* 
 

# Homework

Prepare to present your **ideas**, **experiments** and **creative process** to your colleagues and a special guest next week (28th of October, **formative presentations**).

You'll be presenting your work on:

1. EyeBombing
2. OneTweet
3. The Union Hack

Just to clarify: the **final deadline** for all projects is the **5th of December**, so you can continue working on it throughout November. However, we will be starting another project after the formative, so the more you do before the formative, the better.

### Typography

1. **Publish** your mini-lesson and any other relevant material from today. We recommend GitHub (we :green_heart: :octocat:) but you can publish elsewhere as long as it's accessible by anyone.

2. Add the link to your mini-lesson and any other relevant material to the Google document I emailed you (it's also on Slack).

### Peer learning research ( due for the week after next, Friday 4th Nov)

### Project 

Work on *The Union Hack* with your **team**.

1. Set up a GitHub repository for your team project.
* Mash up existing flags.
* Jot down ideas for places (real or imaginary) and the flag(s) you could design for them.


### Blog 

**Individually**, write about *The Union Hack*. 

Reflect on the concept and document **your** creative process. 

You can post pictures of scribbled notes, or jot down notes digitally. It doesn't need to be fleshed out and well written. The main goal here is to record your flow of ideas, not to make it beautiful!
